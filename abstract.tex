In the last few years there has been a tremendous interest in big data. Most of this data is hard to understand because of its size and dimensions. The importance of this problem can be emphasized by the fact that Big Data Research and Development Initiative was announced by the United States administration in 2012 to address problems faced by the government.

The purpose of this thesis is to outline a system which aims to explain spatially heterogeneous data. In this thesis we look at three different approaches to explain data, namely,  \textit{aggravation}, \textit{intervention} and \textit{salient features}. This thesis introduces a taxonomy for explaining data and outlines a new approach which tackles spatial heterogeneity by using a hierarchy based on spatial indexing/clustering.
